as long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. sumer developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money, while the babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on debt, legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.[4]

the babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts. they developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.[5]

the ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming.[6] the shekel are the first to refer to a unit of weight and currency, used by the semitic peoples. the first usage of the term came from mesopotamia circa 3000 bc. and referred to a specific mass of barley which related other values in a metric such as silver, bronze, copper, etc. a barley/shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, just as the british pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver.[7]

for most people, the exchange of goods occurred through social relationships. there were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. in ancient greece, where the present english word 'economy' originated,[2] many people were bond slaves of the freeholders.[8] the economic discussion was driven by scarcity.
