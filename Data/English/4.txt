the adult white stork's main sound is noisy bill-clattering, which has been likened to distant machine gun fire. the bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes. the clattering is amplified by its throat pouch, which acts as a resonator. used in a variety of social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situationa€”for example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call. the only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various cheeping sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. like the adults, young also clatter their beaks.[77] the up-down display is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. the display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a threat display. breeding pairs are territorial over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended.
