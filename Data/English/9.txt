during the tudor period the reformation produced a gradual shift to protestantism. much of london property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[64] in 1475, the hanseatic league set up a main trading base (kontor) of england in london, called the stalhof or steelyard. it remained until 1853, when the hanseatic cities of lübeck, bremen and hamburg sold the property to south eastern railway.[65] woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century london to the nearby shores of the low countries, where it was considered indispensable.[66]

yet english maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west europe. the commercial route to italy and the mediterranean was normally through antwerp and over the alps; any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan. the reopening of the netherlands to english shipping in january 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity.[67] the royal exchange was founded.[68] mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the east india company were founded as trade expanded to the new world. london became the main north sea port, with migrants arriving from england and abroad. the population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[64]

in the 16th century, william shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in london during english renaissance theatre. shakespeare's globe theatre was constructed in 1599 in southwark. stage performances came to a halt in london when puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s and 1650s.[69] the ban on theatre was lifted during the restoration in 1660, and london's oldest operating theatre, drury lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the west end theatre district.[70]

by the end of the tudor period in 1603, london was still compact. there was an assassination attempt on james i in westminster, in the gunpowder plot of 5 november 1605.[71]


defensive lines of communication, planned during the english civil war, c. 1643, surrounded the city, westminster, southwark, lambeth and related areas (vertue, 1738).
in 1637, the government of charles i attempted to reform administration in the london area. this called for the corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. fearing an attempt by the crown to diminish the liberties of london, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the corporation's "the great refusal", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the city.[72]

in the english civil war the majority of londoners supported the parliamentary cause. after an initial advance by the royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of brentford and turnham green, london was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the lines of communication. the lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[73] the fortifications failed their only test when the new model army entered london in 1647,[74] and they were levelled by parliament the same year.[75]

london was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[76] culminating in the great plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[77]


the great fire of london destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.
the great fire of london broke out in 1666 in pudding lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[78] rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath robert hooke as surveyor for the city of london.[79][80][81] in 1708 christopher wren's masterpiece, st paul's cathedral, was completed. during the georgian era, new districts such as mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the thames encouraged development in south london. in the east, the port of london expanded downstream. london's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.[82]

in 1762, george iii acquired buckingham house, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. during the 18th century, london was said to be dogged by crime,[83] and the bow street runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[84] a total of more than 200 offences were punishable by death,[85] including petty theft.[86] epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.[87]

coffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with fleet street becoming the centre of the british press. the invasion of amsterdam by napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to london and the first london international issue was arranged in 1817. around the same time, the royal navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening dutch economic power. london then overtook amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[88][89] according to samuel johnson:
