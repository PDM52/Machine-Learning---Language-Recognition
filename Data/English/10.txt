with the onset of the industrial revolution in britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of high streets (the primary street for retail in britain) rapidly grew.[91][92] london was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925,[93] with a population density of 325 per hectare.[94] in addition to the growing number of stores selling goods such as harding, howell & co. on pall malla€”a contender for the first department storea€”the streets had scores of street sellers loudly advertising their goods and services.[91] london's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,[95] claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[96] rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. the metropolitan board of works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the london county council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.[97]

from the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on high streets across london and the rest of britain, with lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in piccadilly in 1894, leading the way.[98] the tearooms, such as the criterion in piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement.[99] the city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as westminster abbey and st paul's cathedral bombed.[100]

london was bombed by the germans in the first world war,[101] and during the second world war, the blitz and other bombings by the german luftwaffe killed over 30,000 londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[102]

the 1948 summer olympics were held at the original wembley stadium, while london was still recovering from the war.[103] from the 1940s, london became home to many immigrants, primarily from commonwealth countries such as jamaica, india, bangladesh and pakistan,[104] making london one of the most diverse cities in the world. in 1951, the festival of britain was held on the south bank.[105] the great smog of 1952 led to the clean air act 1956, which ended the "pea soup fogs" for which london had been notorious[106] and had earned it the nickname the "big smoke".[107]

starting mainly in the mid-1960s, london became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the swinging london sub-culture[108] associated with the king's road, chelsea[109] and carnaby street.[110] the role of trendsetter revived in the punk era.[111] in 1965 london's political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new greater london council was created.[112] during the troubles in northern ireland, london was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the provisional irish republican army.[113] these attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the old bailey bombing.[114][115] racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 brixton riot.[116]

greater london's population declined in the decades after the second world war, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[117] the principal ports for london moved downstream to felixstowe and tilbury, with the london docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the canary wharf development. this was born out of london's increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s.[118] the thames barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect london against tidal surges from the north sea.[119]

the greater london council was abolished in 1986, leaving london with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the greater london authority.[120] to mark the 21st century, the millennium dome, london eye and millennium bridge were constructed.[121] on 6 july 2005 london was awarded the 2012 summer olympics, as the first city to stage the olympic games three times.[122] on 7 july 2005, three london underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[123]

in 2008, time named london alongside new york city and hong kong as nylonkong, hailing them as the world's three most influential global cities.[124] in january 2015, greater london's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939.[125] during the brexit referendum in 2016, the uk as a whole decided to leave the european union, but most london constituencies voted for remaining.
